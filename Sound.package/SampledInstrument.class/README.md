I represent a collection of individual notes at different pitches, volumes, and articulations. On request, I can select the best note to use for a given pitch, duration, and volume. I currently only support two volumes, loud and soft, and two articulations, normal and staccato, but I can easily be extended to include more. The main barrier to keeping more variations is simply the memory space (assuming my component notes are sampled sounds).
