This subclass of SoundRecorder supports real-time processing of incoming sound data. The sound input process queues raw sound buffers, allowing them to be read and processed by the client as they become available. A semaphore is used to synchronize between the record process and the client process. Since sound data is buffered, the client process may lag behind the input process without losing data.
