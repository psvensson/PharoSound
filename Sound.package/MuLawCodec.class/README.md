I represent a mu-law (u-law) codec. I compress sound data by a factor of 2:1 by encoding the most significant 12 bits of each 16-bit sample as a signed, exponentially encoded byte. The idea is to use more resolution for smaller lower sample values. This encoding was developed for the North American phone system and a variant of it, a-law, is a European phone standard. It is a popular sound encoding on Unix platforms (.au files).
