The Karplus-Strong plucked string algorithm: start with a buffer full of random noise and repeatedly play the contents of that buffer while averaging adjacent samples. High harmonics damp out more quickly, transfering their energy to lower ones. The length of the buffer corresponds to the length of the string. Fractional indexing is used to allow precise tuning; without this, the pitch would be rounded to the pitch corresponding to the nearest buffer size.
